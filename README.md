# Basic Web Portfolio
This is a basic web portfolio using CCS3 and HTML5. Specifically, this is a training project for web design, in which I'm using CSS Grid to layout a website, then using CSS Flexbox and Float within that layout to further position additional elements. This is all part of a homework assignment for UCLA's Fullstack Web Development Coding Bootcamp (September 2019 to March 2020) where we were given visuals and instructed to write our own code in order to recreate the visual we were given.

## Languages Used
CSS3
HTML5

## Features
The use of CSS Grid to create a custom layout following the visual given in the UCLA Coding Bootcamp homework.
